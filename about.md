This is the new personal blog for Julius Quiaot. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

I'm a software engineer. I'm more of a generalist than a specialist, and even then I'm not a particularly good generalist. But I try.

I care about writing good, clean code. I care about writing clear, informative documentation. I appreciate the art of writing software. I care about process insofar as it helps teams minimize tedious work, smooth out communication, and empower developers to create great things.
