In a previous life (i.e., at my previous job), I maintained an internal blog on our Confluence account, writing about various things on software development that I thought would be helpful in our day-to-day work. I also collected a handful of links to external articles and websites that I thought were interesting enough to share with the team. I can't really share the contents of the articles I wrote (mainly because I no longer have access to them, but also there's probably a lot of proprietary information that I can't share), but I was able to get a copy of the links to external articles. I'll post them here, in the hopes that I can occasionally revisit these articles and reflect on them a little bit.
